# godot-hackday


The company I worked for, Learnosity, regularly held Hack@LRN as our take on a way for our product development team to take a break from everyday work, have fun, explore ideas our brilliant minds have pondered and experiment with new technologies. I originally prepare this post so we can use it my company blog. 

We wanted to learn something new and have a bit of fun on the day. What would be a better idea than building a game? So we decided to put together a side-scroller 2D shooter game that relates to Learnosity.
